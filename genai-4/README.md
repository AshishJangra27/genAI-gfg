# GenAI & Agentic AI Mastery Roadmap

This structured roadmap categorizes your topics from foundational deep learning to advanced agentic orchestration and production-grade operations.

---

## 1. AI Fundamentals & The Evolution of Text Processing
Understanding how we moved from basic neural networks to the generative era.

* **The AI Hierarchy:** * Definitions: AI vs. ML vs. DL vs. GenAI vs. Agentic AI.
    * The transition shift from Deep Learning to Generative AI.
* **Deep Learning (DL) Basics:**
    * How DL models process text (Tokenization, Word Embeddings).
    * Classic Architectures: RNNs (Recurrent Neural Networks) and LSTMs (Long Short-Term Memory).
    * **Transfer Learning:** Reusing pre-trained weights for specialized tasks.

---

## 2. The Transformer Revolution
The architecture that changed everything.

* **Attention Mechanisms:** * Bahdanau Attention (*Neural Machine Translation by Jointly Learning to Align and Translate*).
    * **Transformer Architecture:** Multi-head attention and positional encoding (*Attention is All You Need*).
* **The Birth of GPT:** GPT-1 Paper Review and the rise of Decoder-only models.

---

## 3. LLM Core Concepts & Ecosystem
How Large Language Models are built and accessed.

* **Training Methodologies:** Pre-training (Self-supervised) vs. Fine-tuning (Instruction/Chat).
* **The Model Landscape:**
    * **Open Source:** Hugging Face ecosystem, Gemma, Llama.
    * **Closed Source:** Google Gemini, OpenAI (GPT series).
    * **Inference Providers:** Hyperbolic for Base Models.
* **Communication & Tooling:**
    * Google GenAI and OpenAI Python libraries.
    * **Prompt Engineering:** Techniques for better output control.
    * **Cost Management:** Estimating LLM costs based on input/output tokens.

---

## 4. RAG: Retrieval-Augmented Generation
Giving LLMs access to external, private, or real-time data.

* **RAG Architecture:**
    * **RawRAG:** Building RAG from scratch.
    * **Vectorless RAG:** PageIndex RAG (from scratch for assignments).
    * **When to use RAG?** RAG vs. Fine-tuning trade-offs.
* **The RAG Components:**
    * **Chunking:** Context-Aware Chunking with LLMs.
    * **Storage & Retrieval:** VectorDBs (ChromaDB, Pinecone), Embedding models, and Reranking strategies.
* **Web Integration:** Serper + LLMs for web-search-based answers from scratch.

---

## 5. Model Optimization & Local Deployment
Running and tailoring models for efficiency.

* **Fine-tuning & Adaptation:**
    * **PEFT (Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning):** LoRA and QLoRA.
    * **Quantization:** Reducing model size for local hardware.
* **Local Execution:** * **Ollama:** Running local LLMs.
    * **Local Chatbots:** Building UIs with Ollama + Streamlit (with local chat storage).

---

## 6. Agentic AI: The Future of Autonomy
Moving from static responses to goal-oriented agents.

* **Agentic Foundations:** DIY Agentic AI (Logic loops and tool use).
* **Frameworks:** * **LangChain:** Chains, LangX, and ChatHistory management.
    * **CrewAI:** Multi-agent systems, Tool integration, and running CrewAI with Ollama + Gemma.
* **Use Cases:** Building a Resume Analyzer with CrewAI.

---

## 7. Application Development & LLMOps
Building, deploying, and securing your AI products.

* **Frontend & UI:** Streamlit and Gradio.
* **Backend & Infrastructure:** * API development with **FastAPI**.
    * Containerization with **Docker**.
    * Cloud Deployment: Google Cloud Run, Render.
* **The Production Stack:**
    * **LLMOps:** LLM Evaluations, monitoring, and versioning.
    * **Security:** Guardrails and safety filters.
    * **MCP (Model Context Protocol):** Standardizing how models interact with data.
* **Developer Tools:** Git, GitHub, VS Code, and GitHub Copilot.
* **Emerging Tech:** Diffusion Models (Image Generation).
